Assigning Options in a QWeb Field Converter record can cause UI issues if a field is
defined twice with different widgets in a view.

For example, adding ``{"widget": "date"}`` to the date_approve field in a purchase order
can result in two dates appearing under the Confirmation Date column in the portal view.
This occurs because the field is defined twice with different widgets.
