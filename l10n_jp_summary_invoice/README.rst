This module adds a summary invoice report print functionality based on the
account_billing module.

The printed summary invoice is intended to serve as the Qualified Tax Invoice (適格請求書),
meaning that consumption taxes should be recalculated based on the total amount of the
invoices per tax rate included in the summary invoice.

Configuration
=============

Go to *Invoicing/Accounting > Configuration > Settings* and update the following
settings as necessary:

- **Summary Invoice Remark**: The remark that shows in the header part of the summary
  invoice, such as '下記の通り御請求申し上げます。'.
- **Show Sales Order Number**: If selected, the sales order number will be shown for
  each line in the summary invoice.
- **Show Invoice Narration**: If selected, the narration will appear for each invoice in
  the summary invoice report.
- **Show Invoice Total Amount**: If selected, the total amount per invoice will appear
  in the summary invoice report.

Usage
=====

#. Create a billing for customer invoices using the functionality of the account_billing
   module, and make adjustments as necessary.

   - **Remit-to Bank**: If not selected, the bank account related to the company with
     the smallest sequence will show in the printed document.
   - **Due Date**: The earliest due date among the selected invoices will be proposed.
     Adjust this as necessary as it will show in the printed document.

#. Validate the billing. An invoice for tax adjustment will be created automatically in
   case the recalculated tax amount is different from the summary of the tax amounts in
   the selected invoices.
#. Print the summary invoice report (合計請求書) from *Print > JP Summary Invoice* of the
   billing.
