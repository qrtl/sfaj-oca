This module adds a summary invoice report print functionality based on the
account_billing module.

The printed summary invoice is intended to serve as the Qualified Tax Invoice (適格請求書),
meaning that consumption taxes should be recalculated based on the total amount of the
invoices per tax rate included in the summary invoice.
