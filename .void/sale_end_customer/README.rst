This module introduces the End Customer field in sales orders and customer invoices.
This field is accounted for in sales and invoice analysis reports.

Use Cases / Context
===================

There are trade flows where your direct customer is not the end customer of the sold
products (e.g., you sell to a dealer, and the dealer sells to the end customer). In such
cases, you may want to record the end customers in your sales transactions.

Usage
=====

Enter the end customer field in the sales order as appropriate. The assigned value will
be passed to the corresponding field in the customer invoice when the invoice is
created.

If an invoice involves multiple sales orders with different end customers, the end
customer from the last processed sales order will prevail.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

The module currently does not adjust the invoice grouping keys (`sale.order._get_invoice_grouping_keys()`)
to include the end customer field.
