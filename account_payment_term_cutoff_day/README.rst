This module extends the Account Payment Terms functionality by
introducing a cutoff day field (cutoff_day) in
account.payment.term.line. With this feature, user can define a specific
cutoff day for payment terms. If an invoice is dated after this cutoff
day, the system will automatically shift the due date by one additional
month.
