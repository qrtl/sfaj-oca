This module extends the Account Payment Terms functionality 
by introducing a cutoff day field (cutoff_day) in account.payment.term.line.
With this feature, user can define a specific cutoff day for payment terms. 
If an invoice is dated after this cutoff day, 
the system will automatically shift the due date by one additional month.
